are from an experiment performed by Reuven Dukas from October 19th-21st 2015.

Goal:
The goal of the experiment was to test whether individual Drosophila melanogaster would respond to olfactory cues from the jumping spider Salticus scenicus by reducing their overall activity.

Hypothesis: In response to an ecologically relevant visual predator, Drosophila would respond to olfactory cues by reducing overall activity (in particular locomotion), as that would reduce risk of being spotted by the predator.


Experimental Details:

Provenance of Drosophila:
The Drosophila melanogaster population used was collected by Dr. Reuven Dukas and Carling Baxter in the fall of 2014 near vineland, Ontario (name of collection site to be added). These were maintained in the Dukas lab, and importantly (and unlike populations in the Dworkin lab) had never been exposed to salticid olfactory cues.


Provenance of Salticus scenicus:
Salticus scenicus were collected on the campus of McMaster University in the summer and fall of 2015.

Culturing of Drosophila: (information required from RD).

Preparation of Ss. These individuals were fed Drosophila ad-libitum.

Conditioning of vials for Drosophila activity monitor.

On Friday October 16th, 2015. Spiders that had been fed were individually placed in vials (model and size info). On Monday October 19th, 2015 the spiders were removed and any silk deposits were manually removed prior to the addition of Drosophila.

For each vial, a single Drosophila (which sex?) was added (via aspiration?) at ~8AM in the morning, and placed into the Drosophila activity monitor (Trikinetics DAM). These were maintained under Dukas lab standard incubator conditions (12:12 light dark, with lights on at ?, RH at ?). These were monitored for 24 hours.

Notes: For an unknown reason DAM2 failed to record observations. These records should not be used. DAM1 (8 flies without cues, 8 flies with cues) thus comprise the data for this initial experiment.
