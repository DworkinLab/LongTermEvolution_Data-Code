Notes from Andrew Scott on social aggregation experiment with the 12 long term lines

Note that days 1-7 were from the first replicate (late May), and days 8-15 were from the second (mid June). For "Treatment", 0=control, 1=mantis, 2=spider. For "Sex", 1=male, 2=female.

The median and mean NN distance values in the last two columns are scaled to the diameter of each dish and are in millimeters.

Note from RD: I would focus on the median NND scaled - the penultimate column. Also, the file name is misleading - this is the comparison between the 12 populations, with focal flies being second generation with no predation.
