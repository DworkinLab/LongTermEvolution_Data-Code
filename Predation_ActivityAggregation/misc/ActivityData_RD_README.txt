For the experiments with Drosophila Activity Monitor (DAM) system performed by Reuven Dukas (Fall 2015 and Summer 2016).

Lights on at 10AM (coded with a 1), lights off at 22:00 (10PM), coded with a zero. Reuven noticed, that the program adds a count of one to each cell of the activity monitor at the transition, even in cells without a fly. So check for that!

Summer/Fall 2015 - Experiments with the twelve continiously evolved populations (LTP, LTC and LTS). no predator cues (reared 2 generations without predators).

Fall 2015 - naive population with predator cues (problem with experiment, so we redid it).

Fall 2015 - Examined predator circadian activity. Worked for Spider. Need to redo for mantids.

Spring 2016 - naive population with predator cues. Note from RD: my color codes on the Excel fiels are yellow for light, orange for spider cues and green for control.
